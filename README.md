# Testing Perl Dancer
This repo hosts the code for my tests of web server hosting using Perl Dancer.

This code is based on the Perl Dancer Tutorial Repo here on GitHub. If you want to take a look at that, you can do so here: https://github.com/PerlDancer/dancer-tutorial . A lot of code was pulled from there. I added a few of my own tweaks and features, and will continue to do so.

# Ajax Support
I am now beginning to add Ajax functionality for things like login and updating page content in the background.

# Usage

This code can be run on a web server with Perl Dancer libraries installed. The routing is handled by Dancer, so all you need to do is run the routing program, "dancer.pl".

You will need to also install Template Toolkit, File::Slurp, and DBD::SQLite.
