# Testing Perl Dancer
This repo hosts the code for my tests of web server hosting using Perl Dancer.

This code is based on the Perl Dancer Tutorial Repo here on GitHub. A lot of code was pulled from there. I added a few of my own tweaks and features, and will continue to do so.

# Ajax Support
I am now beginning to add Ajax functionality for things like login and updating page content in the background.
